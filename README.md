### Things to note: ###

* The car code is generated strictly from Faces - other SketchUp entities such as Groups and Components may be in the model, but are ignored.
* The car is centered (more or less) on the origin.
* The size of the car is appropriate for the default wheels.
* The stats and physics of the car are not included.
* Pay special attention to the names of the Materials in SketchUp - they control things like default colors, headlights, brakelights, glow, and flash. The following special names are supported as SketchUp Material names:
 * 1stColor
 * 2ndColor
 * glass
 * flash
 * glow
 * lightF
 * lightB

Multiple special names can be used for any material, separated by spaces.

If a surface is selected, only the selected surface is displayed in the dialog. Otherwise, the plugin tries to generate the polys <p> for every surface in the model.
